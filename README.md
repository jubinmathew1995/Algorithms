# Algorithms
A place where you will find all the algorithms on the go. There pictorial visualization,
extra information and other related resources. You can also find different Programs
implementing these algorithms along with their code.
### List of Algorithms
1. [Search](../../tree/master/search)
	* [Linear](../../tree/master/search/linear)
	* [Binary](../../tree/master/search/binary)
2. [Sort](../../tree/master/sort)
	* [Bubble sort](../../tree/master/sort/bubble)
	* [Merge sort](../../tree/master/sort/merge)
	* [Insertion sort](../../tree/master/sort/insertion)
	* Selection sort
	* [Quick Sort](../../tree/master/sort/quicksort)
3. [Graphs](../../tree/master/graphs)
	* [Shortest Path](../../tree/master/graphs/shortestPath)
		* [Dijkstra](../../tree/master/graphs/shortestPath/dijkstra)
	* [Minimum Spanning tree](../../tree/master/graphs/minSpanningTree)
		* [Prims](../../tree/master/graphs/minSpanningTree/prims)

Feel free to add any ALGORITHMS or source code for any algorithm in ANY programming language, just make sure that you follow the same syntax, also please make notes in form of comments in the source code, so that all the users can understand your source code easily.
